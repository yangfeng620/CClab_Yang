\f0\fs24 \cf0 What I made is a guppy fish. Its body is translucent, so sometimes we find guppy fish can generate light. I done my work based on this phenomenon. The red LED is fish's eyes, green one is its body and blue LED is that beautiful fishtail. These LEDS turn on and turn off one by one.Just like the fish is swimming. \

I used for loop to control the LEDS' light one by one, which I think is really interesting. It's just like what we constantly done in processing. And I'm very happy to use something I have already knew to create the stuff I don't know much about.}
